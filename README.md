# squiggles-fur
 A Godot 4 addon for stylish shell fur

## Supported Version
**4.2.X, 4.1.X** : no notable issues

**4.0.X** : All features functional, but the addon is unable to mark a scene as unsaved, which means the user ***must remember to manually save the scene before closing*** (in order to prevent losing progress).

As of updating, this means that all currently available Godot **4.X** versions are supported
